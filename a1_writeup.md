# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
It is quite complex and since I have had limited coding expierence some of the methods of coding don't make much sense to me, such as many of the formalities like using pop. instead of remove. It took alot of chatGPT explanations and group help to debug some of my code. I tend to go as simple as i can with using the simplest methods even if they tend to be longer.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
I have done some java before so it is nice to not have to do all of the syntax and makes writing the code much faster as it is an interpretive language. Also the color coding of the correct code, and used code is very helpful.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Learning how to navigate VScode and clone and upload the info to git hub has been really helpful. As well learning how to navigate the debug console and learning "clear" for the terminal has been making coding much faster.
